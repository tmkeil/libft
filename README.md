# C++ Modules 00–09 – 42 Heilbronn

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a solid foundation in modern C++ by working through 10 progressively harder modules (from 00 to 09). Each module teaches essential concepts like memory management, inheritance, operator overloading, polymorphism, abstract classes, file I/O, and more.

## 🧠 What I Learned

* Core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
* C++ syntax and idioms compared to C
* Memory management and smart pointers
* Inheritance and polymorphism
* Exceptions and file handling
* Deep copying, rule of three/five
* Abstract classes and interfaces
* Type casting and templates

## 📦 Module Overview

### 📁 Module 00 – C++ Basics

**Topics:** Namespaces, I/O with `std::cout`, basic classes, member functions

Learn how to:

* Write your first class in C++
* Use constructors and destructors
* Manage access modifiers (public/private)

### 📁 Module 01 – Memory and References

**Topics:** References, pointers, memory allocation, `new` / `delete`, `this`

Learn how to:

* Create and destroy objects dynamically
* Understand references vs. pointers
* Use `const` correctly

### 📁 Module 02 – Ad-Hoc Polymorphism

**Topics:** Operator overloading, canonical form, `<<` overload, `static_cast`

Learn how to:

* Make your classes behave like built-in types
* Implement deep copies with copy constructors and assignment operators

### 📁 Module 03 – Inheritance and Initialization Lists

**Topics:** Single inheritance, initialization lists, protected vs private

Learn how to:

* Derive classes and initialize base constructors
* Avoid redundant code using inheritance

### 📁 Module 04 – Polymorphism and Abstract Classes

**Topics:** Virtual functions, abstract classes, pure virtual methods

Learn how to:

* Use runtime polymorphism
* Create flexible class hierarchies

### 📁 Module 05 – Type Casting and Interfaces

**Topics:** `dynamic_cast`, `static_cast`, interfaces, multiple inheritance

Learn how to:

* Use safe casting in polymorphic hierarchies
* Design interface-like behavior in C++

### 📁 Module 06 – File I/O and Serialization

**Topics:** `ifstream`, `ofstream`, file parsing, string streams

Learn how to:

* Read and write from files
* Process input data line by line

### 📁 Module 07 – C++ Containers and Algorithms

**Topics:** `std::vector`, `std::list`, iterators, algorithms like `sort`

Learn how to:

* Use STL containers
* Write efficient, modern C++ with iterators and algorithms

### 📁 Module 08 – Templating and Custom Containers

**Topics:** Function templates, class templates, custom stack implementation

Learn how to:

* Write reusable, generic code
* Build your own versions of STL-like containers

### 📁 Module 09 – Multi-Inheritance, Interfaces, Casts

**Topics:** Diamond problem, virtual inheritance, advanced casting

Learn how to:

* Solve problems involving complex class hierarchies
* Use `reinterpret_cast` and multiple inheritance safely

## 🔗 Useful Concepts Used Throughout

* RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
* Rule of 3 / Rule of 5
* OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
* Smart pointers (where allowed)
* Manual memory management
* STL usage
