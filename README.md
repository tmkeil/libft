# libft – My First C Library

## Project Goal

Recreate a bunch of standard C library functions from scratch – and build a reusable library for future C projects.
This was my first step toward building real C programs.

## 🧠 What I Learned

* **Writing clean C code from scratch**
* **Understanding how common C functions actually work**
* **Memory management and edge cases**
* **Using a Makefile to build and organize a library**
* **Creating and working with linked lists** (from the bonus part)

## ✍️ What’s Inside?

`libft` is a collection of small utility functions like:

- `ft_strlen`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strdup` – string handling
- `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, etc. – character checks
- `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memset`, `ft_calloc` – memory operations
- `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa` – conversion
- `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split` – manipulating strings
- `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, ... – printing with file descriptors
- And in the bonus part: **singly linked list** functions like `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstmap`...
